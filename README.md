# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website.

## About This Project

I am **not a web developer**, and web development is **not my area of focus**.  
This website exists purely as a **personal/portfolio presence**, not as a showcase of front-end engineering skills.

To build this site efficiently, I used **AI tools (ChatGPT and Claude)** to assist with:
- HTML/CSS structure
- Basic layout and styling
- Minor JavaScript where required

All AI-generated code was **reviewed, modified, and integrated by me** to fit my needs.

## Why I Used AI

My primary interests are:
- Software engineering
- Programming fundamentals
- Problem solving
- Backend / systems / general development

Learning modern front-end frameworks in depth was **not necessary for my goals**, so AI allowed me to:
- Save time
- Focus on my core skill set
- Still maintain a clean and functional website

## What This Project Is (and Is Not)

**This project IS:**
- A functional personal website
- A practical use of AI as a development tool
- An example of tool-assisted development

**This project is NOT:**
- A demonstration of advanced web development skills
- A framework-heavy or performance-optimized frontend
- A front-end engineering portfolio

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- AI-assisted development (ChatGPT, Claude)

## Final Note

I believe in being transparent about tools and workflows.  
Using AI is a **deliberate and conscious choice**, not a shortcut taken out of lack of effort.

If you’re reviewing this repository:  
Please evaluate it for **what it is intended to be**, not for what it is not.
